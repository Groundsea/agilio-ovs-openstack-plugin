Agilio OVS ML2 mechanism and OS-VIF plugin

This provides the custom ML2 mechanism driver and OS-VIF plugins required
to support Netronome Agilio OVS hardware in OpenStack. This plugin is
currently in pre-release and is intended to aid in integration testing
with core OpenStack. The eventual goal is to be hosted on OpenStack
infrastructure.

* Note: this plugin requires a recent version of upstream OpenStack. See:
  https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/netronome-smartnic-enablement

* This code is fully functional, documentation and unit tests are in
  development.
